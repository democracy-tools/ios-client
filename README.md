# DemoBluetooth


A demo Catalyst application that demonstrates how to use `CoreBluetooth` to:
* advertise that the application is running on the device and
* scan for other nearby devices that are also running the application.

This application was build as a demonstration demo for the post ["Broadcast to and scan nearby devices with Core Bluetooth"](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/02/16/broadcast-and-scan-nearby-devices-using-corebluetooth) that I published on my [personal blog](https://diamantidis.github.io/).

If you want to find more information about this application and how to use `CoreBluetooth`, you can always refer to the post  ["Broadcast to and scan nearby devices with Core Bluetooth"](https://diamantidis.github.io/2020/02/16/broadcast-and-scan-nearby-devices-using-corebluetooth)  or find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/diamantidis_io).
